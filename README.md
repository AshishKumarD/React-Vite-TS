# React + TypeScript + Vite

This is my version of the template UI made using the original template provided by React-Vite.
### Check out the live Demo here: [demo.ashishkumard.tech](https://demo.ashishkumard.tech/)


## UI Components

The UI Components were mostly custom build or is a modified version of a component provided by [Shadecn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) ui Library such as:

- Button
- Card
- NavBar
- Input

And with a little bit of CSS the UI demo is Ready!

Feel free to use this as a beginner template for your own project.

P.S. Not a responsive ui meant only for desktop browsers.
